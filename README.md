## Naming convention

[Sample type]-[Sample name]-[API]

e.g. client-timeliner-view.and.data.api.

Sample type for the viewer API is:
  * Workflow – a sample that incorporates the full workflow (for the viewer that is: upload file, translate file, displayed translated file in client).
  * Client – a client side example that doesn’t include server side code (for the viewer that is: the viewer JavaScript API)
  * Library – a utility library that other samples use and that developers can use.
  * Integration – a demonstration of integrating this API with another (for the viewer that includes: SAP database, Sharepoint etc...)

The sample name will usually include the technology used too – e.g. asp.net, java, php, etc.
